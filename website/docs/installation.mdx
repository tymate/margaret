Getting Started
Margaret is a library of a set of React components. It lets you quickly use custom UI components and customize them with props according to your needs.

Installation
To get started using it, install the package and its peer dependencies with a package manager:

## with npm

```shell
npm install @tymate/margaret lodash react-icons react-modal react-use styled-components
```

## with yarn

```shell
yarn add @tymate/margaret lodash react-icons react-modal react-use styled-components
```

## MargaretProvider

To use some components of Margaret, you have to add a MargaretProvider component at the root of the application. It contains some internal state, but it also allows to theme components by passing a theme prop to the provider. The theme object contains objects which hold values for common variables such as color, fonts, borders, variants, and more.

Example

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import theme from './theme';
import { MargaretProvider } from '@tymate/margaret';

ReactDOM.render(

{' '}
<React.StrictMode>
  <MargaretProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
  </MargaretProvider>
</React.StrictMode>, document.getElementById('root'), ); Copy Start To use the components
```

Import them from the main package module:

```js
import { Button, Avatar } from '@tymate/margaret';
Copy
Example
import { Button } from '@tymate/margaret';

export default const MyApp = () => (
 <Button variant="primary" fontSize="1em">Login</Button>
)
`
```
