Margaret is a library of a set of React components. It lets you quickly use custom UI components and customize them with props according to your needs.

To get started using it, install the package and its peer dependencies with a package manager:

```shell title="With npm"
npm install @tymate/margaret lodash react-icons react-modal react-use styled-components
```

```shell title="With yarn"
yarn add @tymate/margaret lodash react-icons react-modal react-use styled-components
```

## MargaretProvider

To use some components of Margaret, you have to add a MargaretProvider component at the root of the application. It contains some internal state, but it also allows to theme components by passing a theme prop to the provider. The theme object contains objects which hold values for common variables such as color, fonts, borders, variants, and more.

```js title="index.js"
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import theme from './theme';
import { MargaretProvider } from '@tymate/margaret';

ReactDOM.render(

{' '}
<React.StrictMode>
  <MargaretProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
  </MargaretProvider>
</React.StrictMode>, document.getElementById('root'), ); Copy Start To use the components
```

Import them from the main package module:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@tymate/margaret';

export default const MyApp = () => (
 <Button fontSize="1em">Login</Button>
)
```
